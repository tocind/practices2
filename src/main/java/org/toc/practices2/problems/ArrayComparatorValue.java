/*
For two integer arrays, the comparator value is the total number of elements in the first array such
that there exists no integer in the second array with an absolute difference less than or equal to d.
Find the comparator value.

For example there are two arrays a - [7,5, 9] b-[13, 1,4] and the integer d - 3.
The absolute difference of a[0] to b[0] => |7 - 13| = 6,
b[1] => |7-1| = 6, and b[2] => |7 - 4| =3 to recap, the values are 6, 6, 3.
In this case, the absolute difference with b[2] is equal to d = 3,
so this element does not meet the criterion.
